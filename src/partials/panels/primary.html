    <h3>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</h3>
    <p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You've swallowed a planet!</li>
      <li>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>
      <li>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You hit me with a cricket bat. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
